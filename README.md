# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

When pressing the generate password button a modal is displayed

when pressing the generate button in the modal:
    the inputs are validated
    IF Valid
        Then close the  modal and generate the password
    IF NOT Valid
        then alert the user of which area is not valid (this would be better as a tooltip later)

I've used bootstrap to make the modal and elements to give a nice look and make the html easier

I've used a combination of jquery and query selectors. it could all be jquery but i'm not that used to it yet so just used it in some places where i could do it quickly

this project could be improved by using tooltips and highlighting incorrect input with some red boxes and text
